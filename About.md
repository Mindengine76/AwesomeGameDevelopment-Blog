## Who am I?

I am a newbie programmer studying Computer Science for game development at Falmouth university. Unlike most other students I had no background in programming prior to beginning the course 8 months ago. 

I am very interested in 'gamification' and the application of computer science in people's lives (education and e-health). I am also very intrigued by the social and psychological effects computer science and games have on individuals and societies.

Personally I don't play computer games, but I do enjoy building them. I am also interested in electronics and robotics.

Reasons:
- Its cool
- I'm cool
- So what ever I make is cool!
